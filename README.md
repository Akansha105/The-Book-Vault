The Book Vault
Book Vault is a web application designed for book enthusiasts like myself ,to easily catalog, rate, and reflect on the books I've read. This project allows users to upload the books they've completed, along with personal notes and ratings, providing a personalized reading history.
One of the key features of Book Vault is the ability to add books by simply entering their ISBN number. This enables the application to automatically fetch and display the book cover image, streamlining the process of adding new entries to your collection.
In the view section, users can sort their books according to recency or ratings, making it easy to browse their reading history and quickly find books of interest. Whether you're an avid reader looking to track your progress or someone who wants to share their insights on the books they've read, Book Vault provides an intuitive and organized platform for all your needs.
